# BIMM143_Project_3: 
This repository contains my BIMM 143 Project 3E R code. In this project, I address the following question: To what degree does sequence variability correlate with structural variability in the C-terminal loop of streptopain, a protein in which this flexible region is believed to play a functional role?

**Note:** To run this code, it is necessary to have the MUSCLE algorithm installed on one's computer. It can be downloaded here: https://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm

Included in this repository are two png files: pictures of the protein being analyzed. While they are not essential for the code to work or for any part of the analysis, they are meant to be displayed in the notebook as useful visual aids.
