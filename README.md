# BIMM143_Project_3: 
This repository contains my BIMM 143 Project 3E R code. In this project, I address the following question: To what degree does sequence variability correlate with structural variability in the C-terminal loop of streptopain, a protein in which this flexible region is believed to play a functional role?

**Note:** To run this code, it is necessary to have the MUSCLE algorithm installed on one's computer. It can be downloaded here: https://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm
